one unit in distance from this one in the given direction. int compareTo ( MapLocation other) A comparison function for MapLocations. Direction directionTo ( MapLocation location) Returns the closest approximate Direction from this MapLocation to location . int distanceSquaredTo ( MapLocation location) Computes the squared distance from this location to the specified
location. boolean equals (java.lang.Object obj) Two MapLocations are regarded as equal iff
their coordinates are the same. int hashCode () boolean isAdjacentTo ( MapLocation location) Determines whether this location is adjacent to a given location. boolean isWithinDistanceSquared ( MapLocation location,

- Field Detail x public final int x The x-coordinate. y public final int y The y-coordinate. Constructor Detail MapLocation public MapLocation(int x,
int y) Creates a new MapLocation representing the location
with the given coordinates. Parameters: x - the x-coordinate of the location y - the y-coordinate of the location Method Detail compareTo public int compareTo( MapLocation other) A comparison function for MapLocations. Smaller x values go first, with ties broken by smaller y values. Specified by: compareTo in interface java.lang.Comparable< MapLocation > Parameters: other - the MapLocation to compare to. Returns: whether this MapLocation goes before the other one. Bytecode cost: 2 equals public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj) Two MapLocations are regarded as equal iff
their coordinates are the same. Overrides: equals in class java.lang.Object Bytecode cost: 2 hashCode public int hashCode() Overrides: hashCode in class java.lang.Object Bytecode cost: 2 valueOf public static MapLocation valueOf(java.lang.String s) toString public java.lang.String toString() Overrides: toString in class java.lang.Object Bytecode cost: 2 distanceSquaredTo public final int distanceSquaredTo( MapLocation location) Computes the squared distance from this location to the specified
location. Parameters: location - the location to compute the squared distance to Returns: the squared distance to the given location Bytecode cost: 2 isWithinDistanceSquared public final boolean isWithinDistanceSquared( MapLocation location,
int distanceSquared) Determines whether this location is within a specified distance
from target location. Parameters: location - the location to test distanceSquared - the distance squared for the location to be within Returns: true if the given location is within distanceSquared to this one; false otherwise Bytecode cost: 2 isAdjacentTo public final boolean isAdjacentTo( MapLocation location) Determines whether this location is adjacent to a given location. Parameters: location - the target location Returns: true if the given location is adjacent to this one directionTo public final Direction directionTo( MapLocation location) Returns the closest approximate Direction from this MapLocation to location .
If location is null then the return value is null.
If location equals this location then the return value is Direction.CENTER. Parameters: location - The location to which the Direction will be calculated Returns: the Direction to location from this MapLocation Bytecode cost: 2 add public final MapLocation add( Direction direction) Returns a new MapLocation object representing a location
one unit in distance from this one in the given direction. Parameters: direction - the direction to add to this location Returns: a MapLocation for the location one unit in distance in the given
direction. Bytecode cost: 2 subtract public final MapLocation subtract( Direction direction) Returns a new MapLocation object representing a location
one unit in distance from this one in the opposite direction
of the given direction. Parameters: direction - the direction to subtract from this location Returns: a MapLocation for the location one unit in distance in the
opposite of the given direction. Bytecode cost: 2 translate public final MapLocation translate(int dx,
int dy) Returns a new MapLocation object translated from this location
by a fixed amount. Parameters: dx - the amount to translate in the x direction dy - the amount to translate in the y direction Returns: the new MapLocation that is the translated version of the original. Bytecode cost: 2
