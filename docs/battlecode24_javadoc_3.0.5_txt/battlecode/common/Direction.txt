- All Implemented Interfaces: java.io.Serializable, java.lang.Comparable< Direction > public enum Direction extends java.lang.Enum< Direction > This enumeration represents a direction from one MapLocation to another.
There is a direction for each of the cardinals (north, south, east, west),
each of the diagonals (northwest, southwest, northeast, southeast), and
no direction (center). Since Direction is a Java 1.5 enum, you can use it in switch statements, it has all the standard enum methods ( valueOf , values , etc.), and you can safely use == for
equality tests.

CENTER public static final Direction CENTER Direction that represents pointing nowhere. Field Detail DIRECTION_ORDER public static Direction [] DIRECTION_ORDER dx public final int dx Change in x. dy public final int dy Change in y. Method Detail values public static Direction [] values() Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type, in
the order they are declared. This method may be used to iterate
over the constants as follows: for (Direction c : Direction.values())
  System.out.println(c); Returns: an array containing the constants of this enum type, in the order they are declared valueOf public static Direction valueOf(java.lang.String name) Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name.
The string must match exactly an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this type. (Extraneous whitespace characters are
not permitted.) Parameters: name - the name of the enum constant to be returned. Returns: the enum constant with the specified name Throws: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException - if this enum type has no constant with the specified name java.lang.NullPointerException - if the argument is null getDirectionOrderNum public int getDirectionOrderNum() opposite public Direction opposite() Computes the direction opposite this one. Returns: the direction pointing in the opposite direction to this one Bytecode cost: 1 rotateLeft public Direction rotateLeft() Computes the direction 45 degrees to the left (counter-clockwise)
of this one. Returns: the direction 45 degrees left of this one Bytecode cost: 1 rotateRight public Direction rotateRight() Computes the direction 45 degrees to the right (clockwise)
of this one. Returns: the direction 45 degrees right of this one Bytecode cost: 1 allDirections public static Direction [] allDirections() Returns a list of all directions. This is equivalent to calling values() . Returns: array of all directions cardinalDirections public static Direction [] cardinalDirections() Returns a list of all cardinal directions. Returns: array of all cardinal directions getDeltaX public int getDeltaX() Returns the delta X of the direction. Returns: the delta X of the direction getDeltaY public int getDeltaY() Returns the delta Y of the direction. Returns: the delta Y of the direction
