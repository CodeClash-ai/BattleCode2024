Method Detail values public static GlobalUpgrade [] values() Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type, in
the order they are declared. This method may be used to iterate
over the constants as follows: for (GlobalUpgrade c : GlobalUpgrade.values())
  System.out.println(c); Returns: an array containing the constants of this enum type, in the order they are declared valueOf public static GlobalUpgrade valueOf(java.lang.String name) Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name.
The string must match exactly an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this type. (Extraneous whitespace characters are
not permitted.) Parameters: name - the name of the enum constant to be returned. Returns: the enum constant with the specified name Throws: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException - if this enum type has no constant with the specified name java.lang.NullPointerException - if the argument is null
