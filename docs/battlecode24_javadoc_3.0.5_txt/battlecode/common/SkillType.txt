the order they are declared. This method may be used to iterate
over the constants as follows: for (SkillType c : SkillType.values())

enum constant in this type. (Extraneous whitespace characters are
not permitted.) Parameters: name - the name of the enum constant to be returned. Returns: the enum constant with the specified name Throws: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException - if this enum type has no constant with the specified name java.lang.NullPointerException - if the argument is null getExperience public int getExperience(int level) Returns the number of experience points needed to achieve each level.
