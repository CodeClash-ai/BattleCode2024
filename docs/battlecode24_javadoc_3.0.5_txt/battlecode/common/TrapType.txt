- Enum Constant Summary Enum Constants Enum Constant and Description EXPLOSIVE When an opponent enters, explosive traps deal 750 damage to all opponents within a sqrt 13 radius
If an opponent digs/breaks under the trap, it deals 500 damage to all opponnets in radius sqrt 9 NONE STUN When an opponent enters, all opponent robots movement and action cooldowns are set to 40. WATER When an opponent enters, water traps dig all unoccupied tiles within a radius of sqrt 9 Field Summary Fields Modifier and Type Field and Description int actionCooldownIncrease What action cooldown is increased by within that radius int buildCost Crumbs cost of each trap boolean doesDig if the trap digs all nonoccupied locations within its radius int enterDamage The damage done if trap triggered by opponent entering a location int enterRadius The radius of effect if trap is triggered by opponent entering a location int interactDamage The damagge done if trap triggered by opponent building/breaking at location int interactRadius The radius of effect if trap is triggered by opponent building/breaking at a location boolean isInvisible If trap is invisible to opponents int opponentCooldown Cooldown for opponents int triggerRadius The radius that the trap can be triggered from by building Method Summary All Methods Static Methods Concrete Methods Modifier and Type Method and Description static TrapType valueOf (java.lang.String name) Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name. static TrapType [] values () Returns an array containing the constants of this enum type, in

the order they are declared. This method may be used to iterate
over the constants as follows: for (TrapType c : TrapType.values())
  System.out.println(c); Returns: an array containing the constants of this enum type, in the order they are declared valueOf public static TrapType valueOf(java.lang.String name) Returns the enum constant of this type with the specified name.
The string must match exactly an identifier used to declare an
enum constant in this type. (Extraneous whitespace characters are
not permitted.) Parameters: name - the name of the enum constant to be returned. Returns: the enum constant with the specified name Throws: java.lang.IllegalArgumentException - if this enum type has no constant with the specified name java.lang.NullPointerException - if the argument is null
